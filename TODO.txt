Description
-----------
Management of party-related data, such as persons, organisations, names, addresses, etc. Based on the OASIS-Standard xPIL (Extensible Party Information Language).

Todo
----
Prio 1
* Create patch for static_info_tables (div->selectItemsTCA)
* Create label_user_func for all tables which do not have a clear label field
* Show only the possible 'name types' and 'image types' according to the party/address type
* ISO-Standard for West/East/North/South? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_6709 uses positive/negative values
* Add new 'suggest' type for input fields (see below)
* When merging 'standard'-records into tx_party_models_party, are uid,pid... overwritten?
* Is tx_party_usages not language-dependant?

Prio 2
* Update stock_markets to use hotlist once it's included in static_info_tables
* All date and date/time fields: Extend beyond UNIX time range (e.g. tx_party_persons: birth_date_time)
* 'Optimize' the use of the generated xml-labels (e.g. define a label for "party" only once)
* Events: Extend type-definition (is is a single point in time or a time span?, is it allowed for persons and/or organisations?), perhaps as a general concept for types?
* Check all SQL definitions and remove unnecessary blob fields



New 'suggest' type for input fields
-----------------------------------
* See: http://lists.netfielders.de/pipermail/typo3-project-irre/2007-March/000098.html
* General: Concept which allows it to either use an existing record or define a free text (e.g. issuingAuthority of an Account)

I found a page describing a way of using suggest using prototype:
http://www.ajaxon.com/michael/?p=8
http://www.ajaxon.com/michael/?p=10

script.aculo.us has "autocomplete" fields, maybe this could be better?

The prototype framework is described here:

Wishlist
--------
* Link to Google Maps for an address (either directly with lat/long or trying to resolve the address)
* "Normalize/verify" addresses using the Google API Geocoder (Feedback from Christoph Koehler)



To discuss
----------
* Where should the dependant records be stored? Same page, storage page, ...?
* Which tables shall be "manually sortable"?
* tx_party_contact_numbers: Should contact_hours be an RTE field?
* Should Eye Colour and Skin Colour also be select fields?
* Label of addresses: Make dependant of the country-specific address format?
* Is it ok to use t3lib_BEfunc::getRecord() in the model?
* label_userFunc is nice, but there's no way records can be sorted by this 'virtual' label. Store it redundantly?

Suggestions for IRRE
* newRecordLinkAddTitle option: Optionally, this can be an LLL reference which will be used instead of the label of the table


Design decisions
----------------
* Inherited classes (e.g. person/organisation from party) are built as one database table, with the name of the base class.
** Advantages
*** Simple data access, no joins or views necessary
*** TYPO3 standard mechanisms (the "type-field") can be used to limit the available fields according to the inherited class
** Disadvantages
*** There are unused database fields in every record
*** No direct representation of the class model with the physical database model
